Executable files : 

1) train.py : This does the training of all the images given to it as input

	Usage : python train.py "directory of images" 

2) test_for_random_image.py : This does the test for the randomdly selected image 

	Usage : python test_for_random_image.py "directory of images"

	It outputs two images : 
	first image output is the randomly selected image
	second image output is image mapped on eigen space


3) PCA_train.py : Works for ORL like directory structure

4) PCa_train_generic.py : Works for any directory structure ( flat or hierarchy)



As of now PCA training for any given database is working fine.

TODO:

Code is to be cleaned and arranged propely and documented properly
