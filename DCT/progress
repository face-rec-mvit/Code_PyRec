I'm currently doing DCT for a single image..

As of now, DCT without normalization is done..

After doing the normalization part, i will move on to making this work for the database..

further i feel that,
	reading images form database,
	finding euclidian distance between vectors,
	calculating efficiency,
	etc
are common for all our algorithms, so we could reuse that part of the code.

@kunal :
surely I will make a class called DCT, and include these are methods..
but as of now, i'm just starting of vt these functions. (which will turn out to be member functions of the class)
