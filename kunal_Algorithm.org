1.Different algorithms tackle different face recognition challenges to varying
accuracy.

2.In a dynamic scenario, the recognition challenges vary.

3.The variation above can be triggered by various parameters, one such parameter
could be time:
At different times of the day the illumination of an environment is different.

4.Hence we need to determine dynamically ( based on above parameters like time
etc ) which algorithm is to be chosen.

5. W.R.T point 4 . There cannot be just 1 algorithm which can be relied upon.We
must determine the degree to which the algorithm must be preferred
(contributes to accurate recognition) based on the above parameters.

6.The more the number of parameters , more accurate / appropriate a choice of
algorithms can be made , leading to better results.

7.The parameters MAY NOT bear any physical significance. They are mere pointers
that help us in identifying the conditions at which an algorithm OR a
combination of algorithms is to be chosen.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A sample scenario (Use Case):

Let us assume we have N face images in the database F1,F2,F3,......,Fn
and we have M recognition algorithms A1,A2,A3,....,Am
Also we have K parameters P1,P2,P3,......,Pk

There are two phases to the proposed hybrid algorithm:
Phase 1: The Training phase

This phase is actually the identification phase. Here we basically run all the
recognition algorithms and test for all the N faces. Some algorithm Am is able
to correctly recognize all the N faces hence it has 100% efficiency and
similarly some other algorithm Am' has 77% accuracy etc.
(NOTE: this is supervised learning , as the user must verify the recognition
results of the algorithms)

Now we note down the K Parameters that characterize this experiment.

The Experiment(Training) above is repeated a lot of times to collect a lot of sets of the
Parameters. as below.
                               percentage accuracy
                             /   \
ID---P1---P2---P3---P4------A1---A2
01---09--100---30---0.450--100---45
02---02---78---67---0.001--088---33
03---77----1---88---0.220--097---09


Phase 2: The Testing phase
Now supposing we are testing our hybrid model.
What this model proposes is that , we do not need to run through all the
algorithms and identify which one performs the best. We just need to find out
the values of the Parameters , say for example:

At the time of testing our model, the values of parameters are,

P1---P2---P3---P4---
03---77----1---0.220

The above set of parameters match the ID-3 in the training table. Now we know
that Algorithm A1 performs very well in this situation (set of P values) so we
just use the A1 algorithm (we do not need to run all the recognition algorithms
:)) and Stastically we are sure to get very good efficiency. (In Case we do not
get good recognition , it implies there is another Parameter P' which we have
not considered (IMPT))


Now comes the most important part of our algorithm:
What Parameters should we consider , How do we calculate them and What is their
significance.

We could theoretically try to save infinite number of state data (to uniquely
identify every experiment (training) instance) But that makes increases the time
complexity while matching the patterns while testing.

What we must do , while developing our model is to identify some finite
(preferrbly small number K) set of parameters P1,P2..Pk such that we can
uniquely identify an instance of our experiment (one training instance)

Some sample Parameters can be:
1. Time of day
2. Subject that is being taught ( Or what are the People under the test
condition doing i.e studying, eating. etc )
3. For how long is the subject being taught ( eg. for the past 10 minutes or 40
minutes )
4. What is the average pixel intensity at the time of testing.
5. What is the decibel value at the time of testing (This can be considered an
example of point 7 , this doesn't have any physical significance to
face-recognition but it is a very good candidate for parameter to identify a
pattern)
