\section{Motivation}

Research on face detection, subsequently followed by recognition, must confront with many challenging problems, especially   when dealing   with   outdoor illumination, pose   variation   with   large   rotation angles, low image   quality, low resolution, occlusion, and background changes in complex real-life   scenes. The design of face   recognition   algorithm s that are effective over a wide range of  viewpoints,   complex outdoor lighting,   occlusions, facial   expressions,   and   aging  of subjects, is still a major area of research.      Several models have been found in the literature ranging from    appearance based approaches to sophisticated systems based on thermal information, high   resolution   images or   3D   models. A comprehensive survey of face recognition algorithm is given by   Eigen- faces and Fisher-faces are the widely used and successful appearance based models for face recognition. Different algorithms tackle the above said problems  with varying accuracy. Face recognition is usually performed in a dynamic scenario. The challenges vary in this scenario
