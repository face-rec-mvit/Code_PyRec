\section*{Algorithm}
\begin{quote}
Our Proposed model is a learning Algorithm, which while training runs all the recognition algorithms against faces in a dynamic scene and identifies which algorithm performs the best in the characteristic dynamic scenario. Then while testing, the algorithm again tries to characterize the present scenario. It then matches the characteristic with that of the training phase and executes the algorithm which performed optimally, instead of executing all the algorithms.
We break up our approach into two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{\textbf{The learning algorithm} -- (which characteristics a dynamic scene).}
\item{\textbf{Various Face-Recognition algorithms} -- SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform), PCA[1] (Principle Component Analysis) and LPP[2] (Locality Preserving Projections) to name a few, which perform recognition.}
\end{enumerate}
