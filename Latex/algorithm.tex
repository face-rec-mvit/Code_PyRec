\section*{Algorithm}
\begin{quote}
Our Proposed model is a learning Algorithm which while training runs all the recognition algorithms against faces in a dynamic scene and identifies which algorithm performs the best in the characteristic dynamic scenario. Then while testing, the algorithm again tries to characterize the present scenario. It then matches the characteristic with that of the training phase and executes the algorithm which performs optimally, instead of executing all the algorithms.
We break up our approach into two parts:
\begin{enumerate}
\item{The learning algorithm (which uses a neural network based algorithm to learn characteristics of a dynamic scene).}
\item{Various Face-Recognition algorithms like SIFT (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) , LPP\cite{Lap} (Locality Preserving Projections) and  PCA\cite{Eig} (Principle Component Analysis) which perform the actual recognition. (These algorithms are a representative set, many more such algorithms can be implemented.)
\end{enumerate}
