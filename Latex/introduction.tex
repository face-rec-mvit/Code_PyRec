\section{Introduction}

A general statement of the face recognition problem (in computer vision) can be formulated as follows: Given still or video images of a scene, identify or verify one or more persons in the scene using a stored database of faces.   

Now a days, face recognition systems are gradually becoming popular and plays a critical role in biometric systems.  Face representation   and   recognition   has   numerous applications   including   visual   surveillance   and   security, personal authentication etc. uses. Because of the general public acceptance of face images on various documents, face recognition has a great   potential   to   become   the next    generation biometric technology of choice. Face images are also the only biometric information available in some legacy databases and international terrorist watch-lists and can be acquired even without subjects'/candidate's cooperation. Though there has been a great deal of progress in face detection, efficient face representation and accurate face recognition in the last few years, many problems remain unsolved.
