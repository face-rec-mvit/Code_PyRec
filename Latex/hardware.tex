\section{Hardware Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RAM (Primary Memory)} : A minimum of 4GB (most of the algorithms are very memory intensive and store a whole bunch of images on RAM for faster processing)
\item \textbf{Hard drive (Secondary Memory)} : A minumum of 80 GigaBytes (may be more if a lot of images are there in the database)
\item \textbf{Processor} : 2.2 GHz 4 Core Processor 
\item \textbf{Cluster of 4(arbitrary) computers(Optional)} : The idea is to speed up the computations by distributing the calculations over a cluster of computers.
\end{itemize}
