\section*{Conclusion}
\begin{quote}
The proposed hybrid learning model takes care of all the above mentioned parameters. Then depending on the challenge identified, performs the computation and minimises the error rate in recognition. Thus in theory giving better recognition results than any of the above mentioned algorithms.
