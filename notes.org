* To use Python imaging Library and Numeric Python Together
  - "import Image" // This is a part of PIL with which we will be loading the
    image
  - "import numpy" // The numeric python module
* Loading the image // used PIL
  - image_binary = Image.open('file name')
* Opening the image as a Numpy array
  - image_vector = numpy.asarray(image_binary)
* Once the image is loaded as a Numpy array it behaves as an ARRAY
  - So you can do array manipulations
    - like adding 2 array yeilds an array , as expected.
    - FORGET that you are working with an IMAGE, treat it like a "Numpy"
      array.
* To Convert a Numpy array back to an IPL image
  - image_again = Image.fromarray(image_vector)

* To Concatenate 2 arrays.
  - create a new Python list like so , a = []
  - a.append(image_vector)
  - a.append(image_vector2)
  - convert the list to a numpy array, image_vector3 = numpy.asarray(a)
* Pretty Simple Ain't it !

* Note :

| Variable Name | Type        |
|---------------+-------------|
| image_binary  | PIL image   |
| image_vector  | Numpy array |
| image_vector2 | Numpy array |
| image_vector3 | Numpy array |
| image_again   | PIL image   |
| a             | Python list |
